## About
Assignment 1 from a course at bachelor degree education. The implemented application provides a financial app where the user can e.g.:
- add income / outcome consisting of title, date, amount and category from a drop down menu.
- see a summary over the users total income / outcome amount and total balance.
- see all income / outcome items in a list
  - click an individual item to display more detailed information in a new window. The information includes: title, date added, amount, category and an icon that corresponds to the items category.
